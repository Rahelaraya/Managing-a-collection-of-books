Book Management Console Application

Description

This C# console application allows users to manage a simple book collection. Users can add new book details (title, author, and year published), view the added books, and search for a book by its title.

Features

Adding a Book: The program prompts the user to enter the book's title, author, and publication year. This information is then saved in a list.

Predefined Books: In addition to user-added books, the program includes three predefined books to demonstrate the functionality.

Searching for a Book: Users can search for a book by entering its title. The program checks if the book exists in the list and displays its details if found. If the book is not found, it shows a message saying "Book not found."

Usage

The program will display the book's details if found, or indicate if the book is not in the list.
